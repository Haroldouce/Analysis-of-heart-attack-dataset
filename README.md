# Analysis-of-heart-attack-dataset
In this project, I get to explore the relationship between our human age and high blood pressure. Whether our blood pressure will increase when our age increase.

**Questions to explore:**
 1. Whatis the impact ofAge on the likelihood of high Systolic Blood Pressure?
 2. Is there a significant correlation between the variables Age and Systolic Blood
 Pressure?
 3. Are there any outliers in the Systolic Blood Pressure data that differ significantly from
 a normal distribution?

**Conclusion:**
Through this analysis, we are able to see the relationship between the variable Age
 and Systolic Blood Pressure. The results showed that Age has a very little impact on
 Systolic Blood Pressure in this dataset. The weak correlation suggests that as people’s
 age increases, their blood pressure does not consistently increase or decrease in a
 predictable way. Besides that, when we measured the connection between the two
 variables, the result showed a very weak link between them. This means thatAge and
 Systolic Blood Pressure do not move together in a consistent way in this data.
 Furthermore, this dataset contains unusual blood pressure values (outliers) as some
 people had blood pressure readings that were much higher or lower than most people.
 This tells us that blood pressure data doesn’t follow the usual pattern. To conclude,
 age does not strongly explain blood pressure level.
